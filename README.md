The trend of decreasing instances as the time difference increases is also observed here, although the counts are generally lower compared to the overall content.
- **TV Shows:** Unlike movies, TV shows seem to have a longer time gap between addition and release. There are fewer instances of 0-year differences (1379) compared to movies.
